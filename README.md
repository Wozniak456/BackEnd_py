Instructions for running the project locally:

Docker must be installed on your computer.
1. Navigate to the project folder containing the docker-compose.yaml file and open the terminal here.
2. Enter the command docker-compose up.
3. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/ or http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

To test the functionality using Postman, the project includes the For_Lab1.postman_collection1.json file with collections:
<ul>
  <li>CategoryCollection</li>
  <li>UsersCollection</li>
  <li>RecordCollection</li>
</ul>

You need to connect the "Production" environment for the LokalURL variable to work.
